# StormworksServerLinuxPatches
Patches that allow the game (server64.exe) to run on Linux systems under Wine or Proton

# Usage
All patches are in xdelta format, I recommend applying them with [Delta Patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher) **Ensure you select the correct patch version, I cannot garuntee incorrect versions are compatible!**

# Do I need this?
Are you or your players experiencing "stutters" that occur about every second? Is your server host or machine linux-based? These patches will prevent that pesky stutter from happeneing by disabling part of the console update routine that causes interpretation lag on wine and equivalents.

# What about Windows?
On Windows hosts, the lag is unnoticeable but there may still be a performance gain by disabling part of the console routine.


# I don't see the correct version here?
Eventually this repository will be set up to automatically create patches for new versions of the game, but as of now they are manually created. Because of this it may a bit after an update releases for a patch to be uploaded here.
